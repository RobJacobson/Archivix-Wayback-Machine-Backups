Their struggles, hopes, and passionate advocacy come into even sharper focus as Ben recounts the story of his grandfather, a German-Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis just prior to World War II.<\/p>\n<p>Scott Cooper, Director of National Security Outreach at Human Rights First, describes the talk as, &#8220;An unexpectedly brilliant cross between John Oliver and a Ted Talk&#8230; fun, sobering, and informative.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This will be Ben&#8217;s 15th stop on a nationwide tour and his first in North Carolina.<\/p>\n<p>This performance of M2D is presented in partnership with Every Campus A Refuge, Guilford College, The Guilford College Center for Principled Problem Solving, ELON LAW SCHOOL, Church World Service, and the UNCG Center for New North Carolinians.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are free but donations to Every Campus a Refuge are encouraged and highly appreciated to support current and future guests.
