<p>A few months ago, we released this video:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PwV5LbA9_io" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It  gave people the chance to create their own signs with the messages they  wanted to see about immigrants in their communities. Now, us “little  people” have the chance to create a big sign. A bunch of them, actually.</p>
<p>Today,  we are launching a unique three-week fundraising campaign that, if  successful, will pay for five billboards in the Triangle, Charlotte  and Asheville — and if we raise extra, we&#8217;ll add more locations. The billboards will send the message that we believe in  inclusive communities that give everyone a chance to reach their  potential, no matter where they were born.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/billboard1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304" title="billboard1" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/billboard1.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="268" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/billboard2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" title="billboard2" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/billboard2.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="231" /></a></p>
<p>We  are using a fundraising tool called <a href="http://loudsauce.com">Loudsauce.com</a>, which allows us to  harness the collective power of our community and use advertising space  for good. You can go to <a href="http://loudsauce.com/campaigns/14-help-uniting-nc-get-on-billboards-across-north-carolina">our Loudsauce page</a> to learn all about this  project and to make your pledge in any amount you are able.</p>
<p>We  will only get your money when and if we meet our fundraising goal of  $3,500. If we don’t meet our goal, you never give a penny.</p>
<p>Those  who give at least $100 will have a chance to get their photograph on  the billboards, because we want it to be clear that our community came  together to support these messages of tolerance and respect.</p>
<p>We’re  not just raising money for a billboard. We’re creating a community of  people who reject divisive rhetoric and believe in the basic humanity of  all people. Please join us in this effort.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/09/a-day-for-peace/"><![CDATA[<p>This Wednesday is the <a href="http://www.internationaldayofpeace.org/">United Nations&#8217; International Day of Peace</a>. Across North Carolina and the world, people will be working to add peace to the world on this day.</p>
<p>Of course, many of us do this work all the time. At Uniting NC, we believe our work to build understanding and empathy between people of all backgrounds and cultures is a crucial step toward building a peaceful community and a peaceful world. When we see others as human beings like ourselves, no matter how foreign they may seem at first glance, we are less inclined to feel threatened or ready to fight.</p>
<p>But this Wednesday, we&#8217;re asking you to think about one small extra thing you can do to celebrate peace. The nonprofit <a href="http://www.culturalenrichment.org/">Cultural Enrichment Services</a> has come up with a handy list of ways you can participate in this day, and here are a few of their suggestions for peaceful activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a poem or essay, take a photograph, or create a video that speaks to you about peace. Share it with your friends or post it online.</li>
<li>Watch a <a href="http://www.peaceoneday.org/en/film/jeremy-films">peaceful film.</a></li>
<li>Plant a <a href="http://www.plantingrocksforpeace.org/">rock for peace</a>.</li>
<li>Blog about Peace Day.</li>
<li>Host a multi-cultural dinner for peace.</li>
<li>Talk to your children about what makes them feel peaceful.</li>
<li>Create peaceful art: origami doves, <a href="http://www.pinwheelsforpeace.com/pinwheelsforpeace/home.html">pinwheels for peace</a>, or whatever you like. (If it&#8217;s made by children, it can be entered in the <a href="http://www.wppspeacepals.org/">Peace Pals art exhibition</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have time for any of this, just hug your family, say a kind word to a stranger, do a good deed for a friend. Every little bit of peace and kindness helps.</p>
<p>We would love to hear your ideas for ways that individuals can contribute to a peaceful world.</p>
<p>And finally, a quote from Pema Chodron that gives me courage in my work: &#8220;It’s  important to remember, when we’re out there non-aggressively working for  reform, that, even if our particular issue doesn’t get resolved, we are  adding peace to the world.&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/09/healing-the-wounds-of-911/"><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago, terrorists tore a hole in the New York skyline, killing thousands of innocent Americans and launching the United States into a period of fear and suspicion. Suddenly, people who came from other countries or practiced different religions seemed like a threat. Muslim-Americans felt singled out for anger and discrimination. Jewish-Americans were stung by a new wave of anti-Semitism. And immigrants from around the world faced a far more daunting legal process, along with rising anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>
<p>Many of those divisions and prejudices still linger today, but on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, a diverse group of North Carolinians is coming together to heal old wounds. Muslim, Jewish and Christian volunteers from across Wake County have teamed up to build a house for Habitat for Humanity. They call the interfaith project Abraham Build, and organizers say they hope it will change the lives of the volunteers as much as it does the new homeowners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most effective way to combat bigotry is to build community, and  there is no better way to build community than to work together for the  common good,&#8221; said David LaMotte, of the N.C. Council of Churches.</p>
<p><strong>On Sunday, the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks,  Abraham Build volunteers are inviting the public to join them in a celebration of healing and reconciliation.</strong></p>
<p>All are welcome to gather at 8: 30 a.m. at the site of the Abraham Build house: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=515+Parnell+Drive,+Raleigh,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=35.768383,-78.605204&amp;spn=0.019535,0.038581&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.963048,79.013672&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;z=15">515 Parnell Drive in Raleigh&#8217;s Long Acres neighborhood</a>. Raleigh Mayor Charles Meeker will speak, along with a Muslim chaplain from Duke University. Jewish, Christian and Muslim clergy will offer prayers. And then participants will light candles and walk together to downtown Raleigh.</p>
<p>What better way to spend the anniversary of such a devastating attack than by celebrating the love, understanding and faith that even determined terrorists could not kill.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/09/a-distorted-reality/"><![CDATA[<p><em>Guest post from Uniting NC assistant Francisco Chavez.</em></p>
<p>Most people understand by now that “reality television” is far from realistic. But a new show on the Lifetime network — which trains the camera on a group of people who have roots in former Soviet countries — has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/reality-tv-show-russian-dolls-stirs-controversy-065229031.html">stirred controversy</a> over whether these shows promote prejudice and cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/russian-dolls">“Russian Dolls”</a> follows eight first- and second-generation immigrants living in New York’s Brighton Beach.  The promotional video portrays marching soldiers and images of Matryoshka dolls; followed by beautiful women and brawls at nightclubs.</p>
<p>The show’s women flounce around in short dresses and wave knives during arguments, and one breaks up with a Latino boyfriend simply because he’s not Russian. The men make vulgar comments about women.</p>
<p>The cast says it’s all meant in the spirit of fun, and some fans with Russian roots say the show is an accurate depiction of one aspect of Russian culture — just like the popular “Jersey Shore” shows only one small slice of the culture of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Others are outraged at the misrepresentation of their culture and offended that the show makes all Russians look like “prostitutes and criminals.”</p>
<p>These immigrants are not the first minority group to be exploited and stereotyped for the sake of &#8220;reality&#8221; television. The New York times had <a href="http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/arts/television/russian-dolls-on-lifetime-shows-immigrant-glam-review.html">this take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some Russian-Americans may be offended by “Russian Dolls,” and they can  get in line behind the Italian-Americans still fuming over “Jersey  Shore” or African-Americans appalled by “The Real Housewives of  Atlanta.” Stereotypes are to reality shows what nuclear fusion is to the  hydrogen bomb: you simply can’t have one without the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>For us at Uniting NC, the show is just another reminder of how much work we have to do. With these kinds of  extreme images of immigrants being promoted in the media and on TV, we must work even harder to show people the true picture.</p>
<p>Immigrants cannot be shoe-horned into stereotypes. They are not all good or all bad. They are just people, and should be treated as individuals.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/08/the-difference-a-dinner-can-make/"><![CDATA[<p>Last  night, I found myself sitting in a living room on the last evening of  Ramadan, the only non-Muslim in house full of nearly two dozen people.</p>
<p>They were waiting for sunset so they could eat and drink for the first time since dawn at 5 that morning.</p>
<p>I  was merely waiting for my third meal of the day, but simply being there  was my own personal miracle. A year ago, I had never spoken more than a  few words to a Muslim person. And my thoughts about my Muslim neighbors  consisted mostly of, “Wow, that head scarf must be hot.”</p>
<p>Even  yesterday, before I walked into that house, I had heard of Ramadan, but  had no idea what it meant. Thirty days of fasting from dawn to sunset,  not even taking a sip of water in the heat of August. Thirty days of  praying late into the night and rising to eat before the sun comes up.  Thirty unrelenting days of hunger and fatigue, while the routines and  obligations of regular life go on.</p>
<p>And  yet, during those 30 days, Muslims are called upon to be their best  selves — to be kind and pious, to be generous and compassionate, to  invite family and friends into their homes.</p>
<p>I  have spent a lifetime feeling sorry for people who deny themselves the  freedom to eat or wear or do whatever they want. Yet, it took only two  hours in that house for me to see the error of my thinking.</p>
<p>For the first time, I saw the power in those sacrifices.</p>
<p>While  I spend my days addicted to my own comfort, trying constantly to  satisfy my cravings, becoming irritated at small inconveniences, Ramadan  has taught my Muslim friends to accept that life isn’t always  comfortable. It has taught them to live up to their ideals even when  things are hard.</p>
<p>While  I am so often sequestered in my privileged world, wishing for more than  I already have, their hunger and thirst reminds them to be grateful for  what they do have and compassionate for those who go without all year  round. During Ramadan, a glass of water becomes a miracle.</p>
<p>But  most of all, what I learned from sitting in that living room was how  much we all have in common — no matter how differently we dress or pray.  Many of the women I ate with had been born and raised in this country,  blowing up my perception that Ramadan and Islam were merely foreign  traditions.</p>
<p>And  whether we are immigrants or natives, Muslims, Jews, Christians or  athiests, we all love to be surrounded by our families and friends, to  smile and laugh, to enjoy good food. We all wake up every day and try to  figure out how to do our best, despite our failings and cravings.</p>
<p>I  left wishing I could figure out how to give every person in North  Carolina the opportunity to sit in the living room of someone they  consider “foreign” and understand for themselves how difference  dissolves when we truly see each other.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/06/from-low-class-people-to-just-plain-people/"><![CDATA[<p>Check out <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/28/immigration.georgia.mayor/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">this CNN story</a> about Paul Bridges, a small-town Republican mayor in Georgia who has become an outspoken advocate for immigrants.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about this story is the mayor&#8217;s transformation, from a man who once thought of immigrants as &#8220;low-class people&#8221; to someone who now sees them as human beings with hopes and histories and families — people not so different from himself.</p>
<p>Bridges says the change started with a chance encounter in a grocery store. Before that day in 1999, he had never spoken to an immigrant and disdained people who didn&#8217;t speak English.</p>
<blockquote><p>A brown-skinned couple caught his eye. From the way they leaned  toward each other, he knew they were deeply in love. Words tumbled from  their mouths — a series of sounds without meaning for Bridges. He  listened anyway, wishing he could understand.</p>
<p>He spotted them  walking outside the store, plastic grocery bags in hand. &#8220;Do ya&#8217;ll wanna  lift?&#8221; he asked. They looked at him quizzically, so he tried again, &#8220;Do  ya&#8217;ll wanna ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>The couple and another man piled into his  car, pointing the way to their destination a few miles away: two rundown  trailers in the middle of a cotton field. Bridges dropped them off and  went home to make dinner.</p>
<p>But he couldn&#8217;t get what he&#8217;d seen out of his mind. Nearly 30 people lived in the two trailers.</p>
<p>A  few hours later, Bridges went back to the cotton field, carrying  lasagna and his daughter&#8217;s Spanish-English dictionary. It was the  beginning of a whirlwind journey into a new world that would change his  life.</p>
<p>People he had never noticed embraced him. They taught him  new words, served him soup and showed him the pictures of their children  taped to the trailer&#8217;s walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made me realize that I need to take another look at myself. &#8230; It really brought out the &#8216;me&#8217; in me,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uniting NC doesn&#8217;t tell anyone what to believe about immigration. But we do want to give people the opportunity to do what Paul Bridges has done — to meet immigrants and to understand them as fellow human beings — and then to decide what their beliefs are.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/06/who-is-an-undocumented-immigrant/"><![CDATA[<p>What image do you see when you think of an undocumented immigrant? Is it a young blue collar worker, someone who works construction or does housecleaning, who speaks little English? It&#8217;s probably not a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who has written for the Washington Post, the New Yorker and the Huffington Post.</p>
<p>Today, the New York Times Magazine published a fascinating first-person article authored by Jose Antonio Vargas, a well-known journalist, in which he reveals a secret he has kept for nearly two decades. He is an undocumented immigrant from the Phillipines, who was brought to this country when he was 12 years old by a man his family told him was his uncle. He quickly adapted and learned to love his new home. But when he was 16, he found out that the man was not his uncle. The man was someone his family had paid, using hard-earned savings, to get him into the United States. That&#8217;s also when he found out that his green card and other immigration documents were fake.</p>
<p>Vargas joins a growing number of young people, brought to the United States as children, who are going public with their immigration status. Many are smart and ambitious. They are student body presidents, business owners, talented orators. By stepping out of the shadows, they are blowing up sterotypes and reminding us, once again, that everyone has a story. These are stories we should hear before we make our judgments about how best to deal with the problem of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are believed to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the  United States,&#8221; Vargas writes. &#8220;We’re not always who you think we are. Some pick your  strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or  college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I  grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an  American and consider America my country, my country doesn’t think of me  as one of its own.&#8221;</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/06/consider-the-life-of-a-refugee/"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine fleeing your home in the middle of the night.  You have enough time to grab your family and run. You leave everything else behind — documentation, momentos, diplomas. You walk for days, hiding and trying to keep your family alive. Eventually you reach a tent city where a friendly face offers you shelter, food and water. It’s not home, but it’s safe. You live there for months or even years. Your children go to school in this camp. Your basic needs are provided for, but have no opportunity to work or even to leave the camp. If you are caught outside the camp you may be imprisoned.</p>
<p>You want a better future then living in this camp and you cannot return to your own country. You have the opportunity to resettle in the U.S. or Europe. You apply and are chosen for resettlement in the U.S. It’s like winning the lottery, because less then 1 percent of people in these camps get the opportunity for resettlement. You are told you are going to  North Carolina.Before you leave you receive medical and security clearance and cultural orientation classes. You have been in the camp for so long, that you are scared to go, but know this is the way to a better life.</p>
<p>After a very long plane ride, you arrive in North Carolina with one suitcase per person and a plastic bag with all your important documentation. You are met at the airport by a friendly face, your case manager, and an interpreter who speaks your language.  They take you to your new apartment, which is furnished with hand-me-down items. It it is the first real home you have had in years, and you are extremely happy with it. You are taken to get a meal and left in the apartment to settle in.</p>
<p>The next day the case manager returns and takes you to the resettlement agency (one of seven in North Carolina). There it becomes apparent just how quickly you are expected to settle in. You need to enroll in English class right away. Despite not speaking the language,and having very few skills, you are expected to be fully self sufficient within three to four months. You are overwhelmed . You begin to wonder if this was such a good idea.  You live in a strange place with so many new things to figure out and so little time to do it.</p>
<p>Welcome to the life of a refugee.</p>
<p>June 20 is World Refugee Day. A refugee is a person outside his or her country who cannot return because of political, racial or religious persecution. The definition has recently expanded to include those displaced by war or natural disaster. Resettlement agencies in North Carolina provide services to approximately 2,043 refugees per year.  They are spread all over the state.</p>
<p>Too often, refugees are overlooked or treated as unwanted trespassers in the polarized debate about immigration.  Refugees are here legally and have the right to work upon arrival. They come from all over the world and may very well be your neighbors. The next time the immigration debate becomes rancorous, think about the family described above and the agencies that with few resources manage to turn refugees into productive, contributing members of the North Carolina economy.</p>
<p>Resettlement agencies rely heavily on volunteers and donations of goods.  <a href="http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dss/refugee/nc_refugee_service_providers.htm">This link from the  North Carolina Department of Social Services</a> provides a listing of resettlement agencies across the state.  Contact one of them and find out how you can help. More questions?  Check out the <a href="http://www.refugees.org/about-us/where-we-work/north-carolina/contact/faqs.html">FAQs page of USCRI North Carolina</a>, a Raleigh based resettlement agency.</p>

<p>Dr. Ellen Bialystok has been researching the cognitive effects of speaking two languages for nearly 40 years. She has found that it trains the mind to better sort through information and focus on relevant facts. Bilingual children did better on tests, and bilingual adults were better at multi-tasking.</p>
<p>She also looked at the medical records of 400 Alzheimer&#8217;s patients and found that, for the bilingual ones, symptoms started an average of five or six years later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bilingualism is good for you,&#8221; Bialystok says. &#8220;It makes brains stronger. It is brain exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Uniting NC, we think that understanding other cultures and languages is important for creating safe and prosperous communities where everyone can fulfill their potential. But if that&#8217;s not enough for you, can we persuade you to join us as preventive medicine for Alzheimer&#8217;s?</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://unitingnc.org/2011/05/help-us-welcome-our-muslim-neighbors/"><![CDATA[<p>At one of Uniting NC’s recent events, a woman talked about her conversion to Islam. She said that, once she began wearing a hijab to cover her head, she felt that people no longer saw her. Instead, they saw only her difference. She no longer had friendly conversations in shops or exchanged smiles on the sidewalk. People kept their distance. She felt a loneliness that she had never before experienced.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard her words, I knew that I was one of the offenders. How many times had I seen a woman in a hijab — in the gym, in line at a store — and avoided her eyes? Had I ever made a friendly offhand comment to a woman in a hijab, the way I frequently do with people who look more like me? In that moment, I realized that, unconsciously, I had decided that those women were simply too different, that I could never find anything in common with them. Without even thinking about it, I had dehumanized them.</p>
<p>My work with Uniting NC has opened my eyes. I now see that Muslim women, and men, are not mysterious or strange — and that many of them like to laugh and chat as much as I do. Now, we want more people to get to know their Muslim neighbors. That is why we are teaming up with the Islamic Association of Raleigh. Several months ago, the association’s members came to us asking how they could help, and how we could work together to show North Carolina that Muslim Americans love this state and want to be fully participating members of their communities.</p>
<p>We held a joint film screening earlier this spring, and next, we plan to erect a billboard highlighting the humanity of Muslim people. This billboard will be a statement about the kind of place North Carolina and the Triangle want to be. It will show that we are not content to give into our stereotypes and assumptions, that we believe in giving everyone a fair chance — regardless of their religion, nationality or culture.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/UnitingNC-billboard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1209" title="UnitingNC-billboard" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/UnitingNC-billboard-1024x477.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="286" /></a></p>
<p>If this is a message you support, <strong>will you consider giving even a small donation to make this billboard possible?</strong> Billboards in the Triangle cost thousands of dollars a month. But if we all work together, we can send a message that reflects our core values as Americans and as North Carolinians. And <strong>if you make your donation now, we will be able to double your money.</strong> Thanks to a grant from the Paul Green Foundation Fund of Triangle Community Foundation, we will be able to match the first $1000 in donations.</p>
<p>Please click the button below to donate. To specify that your contribution is for the billboard, just enter your donation amount and, when asked to review it, click the link for “Optional instructions/comments.” Write “billboard” in that field.</p>
