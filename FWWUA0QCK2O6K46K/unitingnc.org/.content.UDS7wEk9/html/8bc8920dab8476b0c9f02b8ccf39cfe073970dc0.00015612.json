It\u2019s an example of This Is Home\u2019s visual approach to the myriad details of the refugee experience. Through brilliant observational filmmaking, This Is Home tells the story of four Syrian families on the path to self-sufficiency and eventual success in the United States. Refugee integration assistance, overseen by State Department\u2013contracted resettlement agencies, provides an apartment and other services for only eight months\u2014after that, families are expected to manage independently. Refugee breadwinners must accept the first job they are offered, learn English, and figure out transportation, the supermarket, school, and cultural norms. The inherent optimism and capability of the refugees undergird the film\u2019s revelatory narrative, with an ensemble cast highlighting the drama and humor of the newcomers\u2019 interactions at home and with helpers, teachers, and friends.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read
