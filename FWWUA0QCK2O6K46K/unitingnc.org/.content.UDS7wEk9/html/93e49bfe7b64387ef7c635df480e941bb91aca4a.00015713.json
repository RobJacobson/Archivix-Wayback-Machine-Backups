Tragically, Selena was taken from this world far too soon.<\/p>\n<p>Join us for a special screening of the 1997 film SELENA, starring Jennifer Lopez and Edward James Olmos. At this Movie Party celebration, we&#8217;ll provide themed props to use during the film, including a handy lyric sheet to make it easier to sing along (even if you already know the songs by heart). Also, don&#8217;t forget to arrive early for a custom pre-show completely dedicated to Selena with her music videos and rare, hard-to-find interviews.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\"
