We will discuss the experiences and take first steps to help refugees, asylum-seekers and other immigrants reunite with their families.<\/p>\n<p>The harsh reality is that US immigration policy makes it very difficult for immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking families to reunite. For people from Latin America who aren\u2019t super wealthy, it is almost impossible to legally immigrate to the United States. As the Trump administration implements a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d arresting asylum seekers, separating parents from children, we now know that the government is unwilling to follow US and international law to hear the cases of asylum seekers fleeing pervasive violence of a scale that most Americans cannot imagine.<\/p>\n<p>We now know that the same administration dramatically reduced the cap on the number of vetted refugees it is willing to accept, and that it is on track to admit less than half of the target number. This means that people who managed to leave wretched refugee camps thinking their children, their spouses, their parents would soon follow, are now in a country with little hope of ever again seeing their loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>America: Land of Immigrants<br \/>\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Most people in this country are descended from immigrants or refugees, whether our family members came on the Mayflower fleeing persecution, or sometime after that seeking a better life. Most of our ancestors came singly and worked hard to make a life so they could have family members follow them.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read
