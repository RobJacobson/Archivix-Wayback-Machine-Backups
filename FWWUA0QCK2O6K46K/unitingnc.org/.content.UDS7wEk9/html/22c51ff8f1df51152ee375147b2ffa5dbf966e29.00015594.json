Donations will be collected outside to support and aid current immigrant justice organizations and efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aperturecinema\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a\/perture cinema<\/a>, Moises, and many others for collaborating on this effort and providing a space to keep the momentum and engagement rolling following the rally!<\/p>\n<p>More on the film:<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in rural North Carolina, Moises Serrano fell in love with a country that refused to recognize his full humanity &#8211; both as an undocumented immigrant and as a gay man. The documentary Forbidden follows Moises\u2019 personal journey as an activist fighting for the American Dream.<\/p>\n<p>Forbidden illustrates the intersection of queer and immigrant issues and addresses the realities facing LGBTQ minorities who have grown up in the rural south surrounded by white faces and homophobic attitudes. The threat is real \u2014 the KKK still holds weekly meetings not far from Moises\u2019 hometown of Yadkinville, and he has found dead rats in his mailbox and white crosses on his front porch. Not everyone in the United States is treated equally or given a fair chance. Moises\u2019 story demonstrates courage, conviction and an unyielding desire to succeed. Our goal with Forbidden is to motivate viewers to take action and inspire young people to speak out so that a story like Moises\u2019 is not simply seen as remarkable, but is seen as normal.<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read
