The resolution was introduced by council member Javiera Caballero and is the first of its kind.<\/p>\n<p>Her resolution makes a firm statement of support for immigrants facing deportation who are in church sanctuary and asks Congressman GK Butterfield and Congressman David Price to present private bills to stop the deportations of Durham residents Samuel Oliver-Bruno and Jose Heriberto Chicas, and encourages other cities who have immigrants in church sanctuary to pass similar resolutions.<\/p>\n<p>Samuel Oliver-Bruno and pastor Jose Chicas are two Durham residents who have been in church sanctuary thus far for 14 months between them. Both have minor American citizen children. Jose has lived in the United States over 30 years, Samuel over 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>We need YOU to attend the vote on June 4, 2018 to show your support. Wear white! Be sure to arrive at least 20 minutes early to ensure enough time to find a parking space. This is a peaceful event meant to demonstrate our support for the immigrants in sanctuary in our community.<\/p>\n<p>*No signs!<\/p>","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"june-4-wear-white-to-support-immigrants-durham","image":{"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n.jpg","id":4090,"extension":"jpg","width":540,"height":960,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":169,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-169x300.jpg"},"home-bottom":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-150x150.jpg"},"home-middle":{"width":332,"height":190,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-332x190.jpg"},"home-top":{"width":540,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-540x400.jpg"},"slider":{"width":540,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-540x400.jpg"},"woocommerce_thumbnail":{"width":450,"height":450,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","uncropped":true,"url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-450x450.jpg"},"woocommerce_gallery_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-100x100.jpg"},"shop_catalog":{"width":450,"height":450,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-450x450.jpg"},"shop_thumbnail":{"width":100,"height":100,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/33748827_217722622339069_7788877213671096320_n-100x100.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2018-06-04 19:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"04","hour":"19","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2018-06-04 20:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"04","hour":"20","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2018-06-04 23:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"04","hour":"23","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2018-06-05 00:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2018","month":"06","day":"05","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_abbr":"EDT","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/2050269418522030\/","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":4091,"author":"22","status":"publish","date":"2018-05-29 11:31:17","date_utc":"2018-05-29 15:31:17","modified":"2018-05-29 11:31:17","modified_utc":"2018-05-29 15:31:17","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/101-city-hall-plz\/","venue":"101 City Hall Plz","excerpt":"<a href=\"\" class=\"more-link\" title=\"Read More\">Read More<\/a>","slug":"101-city-hall-plz","address":"101 City Hall Plaza","city":"Durham","country":"United States","state":"NC","zip":"27701","stateprovince":"NC","geo_lat":35.9960807,"geo_lng":-78.8992581,"json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"101 City Hall Plz","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.unitingnc.org\/venue\/101-city-hall-plz\/","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"101 City Hall Plaza","addressLocality":"Durham","addressRegion":"NC","postalCode":"27701","addressCountry":"United States"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":35.9960807,"longitude":-78.8992581},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"www.unitingnc.org?id=4091","global_id_lineage":["www.unitingnc.org?id=4091"]},"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"June 4: Wear White to Support Immigrants (Durham)","description":"&lt;p&gt;RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT IMMIGRANTS IN SANCTUARY CHURCHES On Monday, June 4, 2018 the Durham City Council is voting on &quot;Resolution In Support Of The National Movement of Congregations of Faith&quot;.
