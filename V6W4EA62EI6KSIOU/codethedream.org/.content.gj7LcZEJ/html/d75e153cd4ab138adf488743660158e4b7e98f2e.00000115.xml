<p>Code the Dream co-Executive Director Daisy Magnus-Aryitey took part in a panel discussion commemorating International Women&#8217;s Day at Boxyard RTP on March 9. Aryitey and the other panelists shared their experiences as women in the workplace, their efforts to bring positive change, and their vision of a more equitable future.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey said she is proud of Code the Dream&#8217;s workplace environment. “One of the moms on our team brought her daughter to the office on a snowday,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “And I thought,&nbsp;<em>This is exactly what I wanted to build.</em>&nbsp;She did not ask for permission. She did not call. She just knew, because we were moms, because we understood, that she could bring her child. That is what I tried to build every day.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Code the Dream&#8217;s Daisy Magnus-Aryitey discussed her path to a coding career, her new position as Co-Executive Director, and CTD&#8217;s recent growth and exciting future  in this Q&amp;A with WRAL&#8217;s TechWire. </p>



<p>When asked about the importance of diversity in tech, Magnus-Aryitey responded: &#8220;We know that if we want to solve complex, real-world problems we need people from diverse backgrounds deeply involved at every step of the way to help build new technology that makes a difference. Innovation requires different points of view and thrives on diverse perspectives. So giving these sharp, driven minds a place to be productive benefits us all. But it’s also the right thing to do — there is no good reason for the tech industry to be excluding so many people, and changing that addresses crucial issues like income inequality and access to health care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recently, CTD Co-founder and Board Member Daisy Magnus-Aryitey spoke with New America about her origins in technology, her work here at Code the Dream, and why public interest technology is important work for the health and growth of our communities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The potential of technology is colliding at this moment in time with the horrors of technology. We&#8217;re at a point where we realize that the social ills and the social injustices can either be exasperated by tech, or they can be alleviated by technology. We all have to make that intentional decision. Are we going to alleviate these problems with technology?</p></blockquote></figure>

Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This week, Apple announced plans for a $1 billion RTP campus, with up to 3,000 new jobs. This comes on the heels of Google’s Durham announcement last month.</p><p>That’s exciting news. If nothing else, it’s cool to think that some part of the newest Apple or Google technology may be designed right down the road by one of our neighbors.</p><p>But which neighbors will benefit most? Who is likely to get those thousands of new six-figure salary jobs?</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tony Byrd was growing increasingly discontented with his job running the coffee shop in the lobby of IBM’s main building in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. He had been working there since he graduated from high school nearly a decade ago, and with two young kids to provide for at home, Byrd, 27, was itching for a new start.</p>



<p>Now you can find him buying coffee from the same bar he used to run, except this time as a full-time IBM employee.</p>



<p>Byrd’s transition from barista to IT worker is part of what has become increasingly necessary in today’s technology industry: companies looking to nontraditional places to fill a growing talent gap.</p>



<p>Byrd is a recent graduate of IBM’s apprenticeship program — a 12-month-long training program for workers without advanced degrees, where he learned coding languages like JavaScript, Python and C#. It’s a win-win for Byrd and IBM. He has the chance to start a career in the tech industry and receive a big raise from his barista days. And IBM has gained an employee who says he’s in no hurry to leave Big Blue.</p>



<p>“It meant a lot and took a weight off my shoulders,” Byrd said of being hired full time. When asked whether it made him feel a sense of loyalty to the company, he said it did.</p>



<p>IBM’s apprenticeship program was pioneered at its RTP office in 2017. Since then, the program has spread to several IBM offices. In two years, it has led to nearly 200 employees being taught how to code, run cybersecurity and a host of other skills. Around 90% of people in the program have become full-time IBM employees, the company said.</p>



<p>Kelli Jordan, director of career and skills at IBM, said the program was born of necessity, with hundreds of thousands of IT job openings around the country going unfilled.</p>



<p>“Every company is becoming a tech company in some sort of way. … It is a bit of a numbers game,” she said. “There’s over 700,000 (unfilled) tech jobs, and when you look at candidates that are coming out of the traditional pipeline, there are only about 70,000 with a computer science degree. Those numbers don’t match up.”</p>



<p>So IBM came to the realization it had to recruit differently.</p>



<p>“That meant looking at community colleges and coding boot camps,” she said, rather than just depending on the universities producing enough computer science graduates.</p>



<p>The apprenticeship model — where potential workers get paid while they learn new skills — has been around for a long time, mainly in the trades. IBM says it’s one of the first tech companies to try the model. In the IBM program, apprentices receive 200 hours of learning on average, both in the classroom and in real-life projects, applying new skills and getting real-time feedback.</p>



<p>Jordan said she has received loads of calls from other companies about how to set up a similar program.</p>



<p>Advertising</p>



<p>IBM isn’t the only local tech company looking for ways to recruit employees from nontraditional places. And with more than 28,000 IT job postings in North Carolina in December — a 10.8% increase from the year prior, according to the N.C. Tech Association — there are plenty of options for the most qualified workers, forcing companies to focus on retention and mining new talent.</p>



<p>A survey of Raleigh-area chief information officers by the recruitment firm Robert Half found that 46% of them were willing to be more flexible on skills requirements and provide training to new hires.</p>



<p>Companies like Lenovo have created internship pipelines at local community colleges, giving opportunities to dozens of students every year. Fidelity is now funding a scholarship at Wake Technical Community College for students studying cloud storage and cybersecurity to chip away at the local talent gap in those fields. In the past year, SAS Institute has made it easier for autistic workers to find opportunities at its company. And Credit Suisse has launched an initiative at its RTP office to help train workers — many of them women — who have been out of the workforce for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>“It was created to target an overlooked talent pool of qualified candidates,” Sophia Wajnert, head of Credit Suisse Raleigh, said of the program in an interview with The News &amp; Observer last year. “We realized there were talented individuals who struggle to return to work after a career break.”</p>



<p>As an added benefit, tech companies could also increase their workforce diversity by hiring from nontraditional sources of talent. North Carolina, as a state, lags behind much of the country when it comes to diversity in the tech industry, despite it being one of the more diverse states.</p>



<p>“For us, it definitely has helped with diversity,” IBM’s Jordan said. “We do see candidates who may have not been able to go to a traditional college but have been able to build skills.”</p>



<p>Dan Rearick, executive director of Code the Dream, a nonprofit that focuses on teaching immigrant youths how to code, said his coding boot camp was founded on the premise that tech companies would be willing to hire workers without bachelor’s degrees. A lot of the organization’s students did well in school, he said, but because they were Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, or “Dreamers”) many skipped college because they didn’t qualify for in-state tuition.</p>



<p>“Employers are, for the most part, very willing to consider people who don’t have a traditional background, or a computer science degree,” Rearick said. But he has found that most need to land a long-term internship at a company before they will be hired.</p>



<p>Fernando Osorto, 25, who immigrated to North Carolina from Honduras, worked in carpentry before he enrolled at Code the Dream, learning coding languages like Ruby on Rails. He now works at Duke University as a web application developer.</p>



<p>In his view, more companies should take a chance on coding boot camp graduates because they spend as much time learning code as many students in traditional schools. Yet, when he was applying for jobs after graduating, he thinks his resume was often passed over because he didn’t have a four-year degree.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until he proved his capabilities in an internship at Duke that he got a full-time gig.</p>



<p>“A lot of the jobs I applied to in their qualifications they would say you need a bachelor’s in computer science,” he said. “So even though I had the experience … . I think that was the reason I didn’t get a call back.”</p>



<p>If more companies looked beyond people with four-year computer science degrees, Osorto said, “I think it would greatly impact the outcome of the diversity in the tech world.”</p>

<p>DURHAM, N.C. (WTVD) &#8212; We&#8217;re 20 miles away but murals in downtown Durham are your portal to the North Carolina Museum of Art.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can walk in and it&#8217;ll take you to the exhibition at the N.C. Museum of Art,&#8221; said Irene Serrano, Code the Dream.</p>



<p>Code the Dream exposes under represented groups to the world of computer coding-completely for free.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been both frustrating but then once we got it figured out it&#8217;s like yes, we&#8217;re one of the first ones to figure this one out,&#8221; Serrano said.</p>



<p>The two murals on East Chapel Hill Street in Durham pay homage to the Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo exhibit at the North Carolin Museum of Art. And with the Mariposa AR app created by Irene and Code the Dream, people can take a look inside through this augmented reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really great because we&#8217;re wanting to increase accessibility and just conveying the idea that the museum is really for everybody across the whole state not just for folks who are used to going to it in Raleigh,&#8221; said Angela Lombardi, NC Museum of Art.</p>



<p>You can also learn about the artists and stories of immigration, which is a theme of the mural represented by the butterflies &#8211; creating a community.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just all a way to connect people together in ways that have all been just thought of before but not done yet so it&#8217;s very exciting,&#8221; Serrano said.</p>



<p>If you want to download the app, you can take a picture of the QR code at the mural or visit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/" target="_blank">codethedream.org</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be in Durham, Raleigh and Mexico all at the same time? By simply holding your phone up to two murals in downtown Durham, you can do just that.</p>



<p>A new augmented reality (AR) app has the power to transport you through a virtual portal to the inside of Raleigh’s North Carolina Museum of Art, where the exhibit “Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Mexican Modernism” is on display through this Sunday, Jan. 26.</p>



<p>The app, called Mariposa AR and designed by two programmers at Durham’s Code The Dream school—which we&nbsp;<a href="https://grepbeat.com/2019/03/05/code-the-dream-is-diversifying-tech-with-a-focus-on-giving-back/">wrote about</a>&nbsp;last year—launched on Wednesday. That drew a crowd to the two side-by-side murals located on the 100 block of East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, directly across from the Ninth Street Bakery parking lot.</p>



<p>The murals—”I Am My Own Muse” by Cecilia Lueza and “Juchari Ziranhua / Nuestros Raices/ Our Roots,” by Cornelio Campos— were commissioned by the NCMA in the fall. The murals are inspired by the work of artists like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and feature large yellow butterflies flitting about.</p>



<p>“It talks a lot about a community of support and a community of creativity that was happening at that time in Mexico City,” said Angela Lombardi, manager of academic and community outreach at the North Carolina Museum of Art. “To take that work from the exhibition and turn it into a piece of public art was a nice connection in terms of celebrating the Latinx community in Durham and also across the state.”</p>



<p>When using the app, you hold your phone in front of the yellow butterflies to launch the AR. Among other things, you can walk through a portal that will then give you a 360 degree view of the exhibit at the NCMA. You can also see the stories of others who have viewed the mural—especially the story of how they and their families came to America—while adding your own to the mix.</p>



<p>While the exhibit will end on Jan. 26, the app will keep it alive at least for the foreseeable future. There are currently no end dates scheduled for the app or the murals.</p>



<p>The AR side of the project, commissioned by Google Fiber, was created by a team from Code the Dream, a Durham-based software development nonprofit that gives people from diverse low-income backgrounds the chance to gain tech experience while building apps that help the community. Their team consisted of two developers and a supervisor.</p>



<p>The developers, Irene Serrano and Jorge Rodriguez, are both originally from Mexico. To them, this project hit close to home.</p>



<p>“Just being able to show this to anyone in the world, even in Mexico City,” Rodriguez said. “That I created an app that basically ties in with Frida and Diego in such a way that they’re able to see it without bringing them all over here I think is very powerful.”</p>



<p>Serrano echoed his sentiments about the app’s ability to transcend borders.</p>



<p>“You can go in the app and share your immigration story or about your ancestors or read other peoples’,” she said. “So it’s connecting everything—connecting peoples’ stories, connecting art.”</p>

<p><strong>DURHAM</strong>&nbsp;– Ever feel the urge to jump into a mural like Mary Poppins and get transported into another reality?</p>



<p>Well, now you can.</p>



<p>A new augmented reality app called&nbsp;<a href="/mariposa-ar/">Mariposa AR</a>&nbsp;–commissioned by&nbsp;<a href="https://fiber.google.com/?utm_expid=.ELF1DbWeTiuApFupIebq5w.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.cbc-raleigh.com%2Fowa%2F">Google Fiber</a>&nbsp;and developed by&nbsp;<a href="/">Code the Dream</a>&nbsp;— allows visitors to interact with two murals in downtown Durham inspired by artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.</p>



<p>“AR is still new, and working with these technologies has been a challenge and a joy at the same time,”&nbsp;said Jorge Rodriguez, who is originally from Mexico and one of the student developers who created the app.</p>



<p>“While working on Mariposa AR, I’ve learned the satisfaction and also the frustration from working with cutting-edge technology,” added Irene Serrano, the other student developer.</p>



<p>Code the Dream is a Durham-based software development nonprofit that gives people from diverse low-income backgrounds the chance to gain tech experience while building apps that help the community.</p>



<p>The murals are located on the 100 block of East Chapel Hill Street, directly across from Ninth Street bakery parking lot, on the side of the Downtown&nbsp;Durham Convention Center.</p>



<p>They were installed in late 2019 by the North Carolina Museum of Art (NCMA)&nbsp;to celebrate the Museum’s exhibition&nbsp;Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and Mexican Modernism from the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection, currently on view until Jan. 26.</p>



<p>The installation includes&nbsp;I Am My Own Muse&nbsp;by Cecilia Lueza, inspired by Frida Kahlo, and&nbsp;Juchari Ziranhua / Nuestros Raices/ Our Roots, by Cornelio Campos, inspired by Diego Rivera.</p>



<p>Through the app, spectators can stop at the mural and leave their own stories, including sharing where their family originally came from.</p>



<p>Inspired by the migrating butterfly in Campos’ mural, the app then zooms out to show the entire world, with butterflies representing each user all coming together to land in this one North Carolina city.</p>



<p>In Lueza’s mural depicting an image of Frida Kahlo, viewers can walk through a “portal” into the Museum’s exhibition galleries, even after it closes Jan. 26.</p>



<p>“The downtown Durham mural project connects the arts, education and technology, bringing diverse folks together to learn about and from each other,” said Jess George, Google Fiber’s government and community affairs manager, in a statement.  </p>
