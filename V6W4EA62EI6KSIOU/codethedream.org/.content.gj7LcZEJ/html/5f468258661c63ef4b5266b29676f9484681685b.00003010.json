Over half of children born today are people of color, and 1 in 4 have an immigrant parent.&nbsp;Yet Silicon Valley and the U.S. tech economy do not look like our diverse population.&nbsp; That results in a lot of missed opportunities for all of us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code the Dream recognizes that people from  immigrant backgrounds and communities of color have great ideas and will play a huge part in our 21st century economy. Already immigrants are more than twice as likely to start their own business, and those businesses create over 25% of new jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you imagine if more people with that drive knew how to code? Together we can make it happen.

She earned her BA in Computer Science in 2011 and mainly focused on Cisco networking and computer maintenance. But she always dreamed of being a developer so in 2017 she came to the US to continue her education. Unfortunately, she was not able to obtain her master\u2019s because it was very expensive to go to the university. Luckily, she got the chance to learn at Code the Dream for free. She started her course at Code the Dream in September 2019 and began her apprenticeship in December 2019 where she was able to work on real projects and learn to build both web apps and mobile apps. At the end of 2020, she become a proud first-time mom.

With that in mind, she moved to California where she worked with various tech companies as a web developer, and in 2019 moved to southern Mexico. She believes strongly in the power of programming and was looking to find a way to use that to make a positive impact. She was lucky enough to find Code the Dream and be able to join this incredible organization and works from Mexico as a developer and mentor for CTD.<\/div>\n                      <\/div>\n\n                    <\/div>\n\n\n\n                      <\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 id=\"Board-directors\"><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"board-of-directors-section\">Board of Directors <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aris Buinevicius&nbsp;<\/strong>|&nbsp;<em>Chair |<\/em>&nbsp;Formerly Co-Founder \/ CTO, ChannelAdvisor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ana Maria Echeverri&nbsp;<\/strong>| <em>Treasurer |<\/em>&nbsp;Expert Labs Technical Training Program Director, IBM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Diane Evia-Lanevi&nbsp;<\/strong>| Founder, The Tomorrow Fund for Hispanic Students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Laboy<\/strong>&nbsp;| Head of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion &amp; Sustainability, Spoonflower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Daisy Magnus-Aryitey<\/strong> | Co-Executive Director, Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carlos Pignataro<\/strong>&nbsp;| CTO, Customer Experience, Cisco.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Manuel Ramos Gonzalez<\/strong>&nbsp;| Software Engineer, IBM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Rearick<\/strong>&nbsp;| Co-Executive Director, Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Susan Rohol&nbsp;<\/strong>| SVP and Chief Privacy Officer, WarnerMedia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Selamawit Shibru<\/strong>&nbsp;| Front-end Software Developer, TCS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jennifer Zachary<\/strong>&nbsp;| General Counsel, Merck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As America changes, the tech industry has been slow to keep up.
