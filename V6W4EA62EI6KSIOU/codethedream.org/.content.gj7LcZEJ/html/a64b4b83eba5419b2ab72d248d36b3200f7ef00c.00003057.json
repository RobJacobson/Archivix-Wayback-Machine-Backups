The founder recommended me to Code the Dream. I love volunteering and working in a multicultural environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to be a software developer?<\/strong><br>The first time I fully decided to be a software developer was after I moved to the US and saw that there was a very high demand for developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What kinds of work were you doing before Code the Dream?<\/strong><br>I worked as a cashier full time for over a year before going back to school and then joining Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why did you move to the US, and when?<\/strong><br>I came here through the Diversity Visa Lottery in 2018.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has your experience been like at Code the Dream?<\/strong><br>For me, Code the Dream is family. We help each other, we share our experiences. Since most of the people are from different countries, it feels like I\u2019m somewhere with my family and friends. Everyone supports us whenever we need help or just have a question during coding. I love working with these people and I\u2019m never scared to ask questions because everyone is so friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your favorite project that you have worked on and why?<\/strong><br>I\u2019m working on a Falcon project. The reason I like it is because we started it from scratch and it\u2019s an internal project for Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is that project meaningful to you?<\/strong><br>We work as a group, but once it\u2019s done, all of our co-workers will be able to see what we have been working on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you want people to know about Code the Dream?<\/strong><br>When I moved to the US, everything was different. But you will not be scared to make friends at Code the Dream. Everyone is very friendly. I would recommend people to join to experience the friendships, you don\u2019t even feel like you are away from family here.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selamawit Shibru joined Code the Dream as an intern in October, 2020.
