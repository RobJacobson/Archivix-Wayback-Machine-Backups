We are grateful for every single volunteer that works to support our students and apprentices in the many ways they show up: mentoring, leading workshops, reviewing assignments, pair programming, project coaching and more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some go above and beyond. We are excited to recognize that service and celebrate their contributions by honoring CTD&#8217;s Volunteer of the Month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>February&#8217;s volunteer of the month is Kon Ham! Thanks for all your work, Kon! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked why he values his work s a CTD volunteer, Kon responded with this message:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My name is Kon. I&#8217;m a software engineer at a growing tech startup in Boston, Massachusetts that builds products for engineering management.<\/p><p>I was born in Korea. My parents immigrated to the US when I was 1 or 2 years old.<\/p><p>I love coding because coding gives me an opportunity to be part of a team that solves problems creatively, elegantly, and effectively. I love coding because there is sufficient depth of material that I know I can spend the rest of my life improving my coding skills. Finally, I love coding because it gives me a fulfilling job that meets my lifestyle needs.<\/p><p>I love to volunteer at Code the Dream because it is an encouragement to see new faces every day that are desiring to learn a valuable skill to contribute to the growing field of tech. Those new faces are a representation of the many different cultures, backgrounds, and experiences that can one day be leveraged to make the world a better place.<\/p><p>I love volunteering at Code the Dream because it is a mission that is close to my heart. For approximately 20 years I was undocumented in a country that I loved.<\/p><p>I love the people, I love the land, and I love the values. Because of that, six months after I was naturalized, I joined the armed services as an enlisted member of the United States military. But for better or worse, that experience of being undocumented made a deep and lasting impression on me.<\/p><p>With my background in mind, I continue my tradition of being in service to others by volunteering my time at Code the Dream. I volunteer here because I believe people are not wrong or criminals for existing. I believe those same people from traditionally underrepresented or historically excluded groups can demonstrate and contribute value in a growing and incredibly important industry.<\/p><p>I volunteer at Code the Dream because I believe that I can make an impact on this field by volunteering my time be a mentor.<\/p><p>Do you want to make a lasting impact on the lives of others? <\/p><p>Mentor with Code the Dream. It is hard work but oftentimes great things can follow from hard work.<\/p><p>Sign up with Code the Dream today!&#8221;<\/p><cite>Kon Ham<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about volunteering at Code the Dream <a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/volunteer\/\">HERE<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a nonprofit tech organization, Code the Dream relies on software development volunteers to make our program a success.
