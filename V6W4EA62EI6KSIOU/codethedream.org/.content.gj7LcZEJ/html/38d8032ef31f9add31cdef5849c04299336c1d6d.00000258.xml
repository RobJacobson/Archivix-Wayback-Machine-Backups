<p>Women&#8217;s History Month is a good time to reflect on the role women have always played in innovation &#8212; even when seemingly insurmountable barriers were put in their way. On November 25, 1715, Sybilla Masters received a patent for her corn mill design. Masters was the first American-born person to receive a patent, but under British law it had to be issued to her husband, with a note that the invention &#8220;was found out by Sybilla, his wife.&#8221; Charlotte Smith, a fierce advocate for women&#8217;s economic rights and the celebration of women inventors, convinced the US Patent Office to publish a list of women patent holders in 1888, among many other achievements.</p>



<p>Code the Dream recommends learning more about women and innovation through this insightful presentation from the <a href="https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/inventive-women"><strong>National Women&#8217;s History museum</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In celebration of Pride Month, we are committing to learn even more about how we can create an inclusive, equitable workplace for everyone.</p>



<p>Here are a few resources that weâ€™ve found valuable.</p>



<h2>LGBTQ+ STEM ICONS</h2>



<p>This course from Code Academy offers an opportunity to learn more about important figures in the LGBTQ+ tech community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>These are amazing people who have paved the way for LGBTQ+ inclusivity in tech. Many of their accomplishments in tech affect the technology we use today, and the LGBTQ+ activism they have led has influenced LGBTQ+ acceptance in the modern world.</em></p><cite>&#8211; Code Academy</cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>TRACKING LGBTQ+ -RELATED LEGISLATION NATIONWIDE</strong></h2>



<p>Legislation is being introduced around the country to limit the rights of Trans people. To understand where and how this legislation is being implemented, follow the Freedom For All Americans and ACLU links below.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>During the 2021 legislative session dozens of states will consider legislation related to LGBTQ discrimination. Some bills will seek to advance the comprehensive nondiscrimination laws that LGBTQ people so sorely need, while others will almost certainly attempt to single out and target LGBTQ people for unfair and unequal treatment. Freedom for All Americans is tracking each relevant bill in our 2021 Legislative Tracker, in partnership with the Equality Federation.</p><cite>&#8211; Freedom for All Americans website</cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>4 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR WORKPLACE EQUITABLE FOR TRANS PEOPLE</strong></h2>



<p>Creating a safe, inclusive work space is paramount to good company culture. That means investing the necessary time and resources, and being an active listener. This quick piece from NPR gives a few examples on how to begin the process of building that strong company culture.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Even if employers and coworkers genuinely want to be inclusive, they often aren&#8217;t sure where to start. Here are four ways that you can make your workplace â€” digital or otherwise â€” more welcoming and equitable for trans people.</p><cite>&#8211; NPR website</cite></blockquote>
