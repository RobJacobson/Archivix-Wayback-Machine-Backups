<p>As a nonprofit tech organization, Code the Dream relies on software development volunteers to make our program a success. We are grateful for every single volunteer that works to support our students and apprentices in the many ways they show up: mentoring, leading workshops, reviewing assignments, pair programming, project coaching and more!</p>



<p>But some go above and beyond. We are excited to recognize that service and celebrate their contributions by honoring CTD’s Volunteer of the Month.</p>



<p>March&#8217;s volunteer of the month is Diana Liao. Thanks for all your work, Diana! </p>



<p>Diana was kind enough to spend some of her time on a short Q&amp;A session with Code the Dream:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>CTD:</strong> Tell us a little about yourself.</p><p><strong>DL:</strong> I’m currently a Ruby on Rails developer at Cofense, a company that offers anti-phishing solutions. I started about 6 months ago, after finishing a full-time bootcamp in June of last year. I’ve been interested in coding since my first computer (a Commodore 64), and had been contemplating a coding bootcamp for most of the last ten years, but many stars had to align before I felt comfortable taking a break from working and diving in.</p><p><strong>CTD:</strong> Why did you get involved with Code the Dream?</p><p><strong>DL:</strong> Making a career shift to an entry level junior position in your mid 30s can be a little jarring! My last job was in the nonprofit sector and my interests still lie in social good. My coding skills aren’t quite leveled up yet, but when I realized I could make an immediate impact with Code the Dream, I jumped at the chance! Not only does CtD&#8217;s mission align with my values, even though I don’t have much professional experience to bring as a mentor, I do know what it’s like to go through a coding bootcamp!</p><p><strong>CTD:</strong> What has been meaningful about your experience with Code the Dream?</p><p><strong>DL:</strong> It’s been great meeting such a large swath of driven people. Everyone on the CtD side, staff and volunteers alike, seem to care about the students almost to a fault. Every student I’ve worked with has an admirable commitment to learn and make a big change in their life. I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;ve found a place where I can make a meaningful and immediate contribution.</p><p><strong>CTD:</strong> Anything else you would like to share? </p><p><strong>DL:</strong> Pretty sure this is actually true: all of the cat caretakers in my bootcamp cohort got jobs within 3 months . Consider adoption or fostering today! (My forever foster is featured in my photo.)”</p></blockquote>

<p>Outreach staff use Vamos to create “Sites” (labor camps or houses where farmworkers live), or “Groups” (collections of sites, like “May 15 outreach list” or “Camps near our office”), write up “Visits” (reports on trips made to a site), and “Notes” (information or alerts that need follow up).</p>

<p>Women&#8217;s History Month is a good time to reflect on the role women have always played in innovation &#8212; even when seemingly insurmountable barriers were put in their way. On November 25, 1715, Sybilla Masters received a patent for her corn mill design. Masters was the first American-born person to receive a patent, but under British law it had to be issued to her husband, with a note that the invention &#8220;was found out by Sybilla, his wife.&#8221; Charlotte Smith, a fierce advocate for women&#8217;s economic rights and the celebration of women inventors, convinced the US Patent Office to publish a list of women patent holders in 1888, among many other achievements.</p>



<p>Code the Dream recommends learning more about women and innovation through this insightful presentation from the <a href="https://www.womenshistory.org/exhibits/inventive-women"><strong>National Women&#8217;s History museum</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Code the Dream co-Executive Director Daisy Magnus-Aryitey took part in a panel discussion commemorating International Women&#8217;s Day at Boxyard RTP on March 9. Aryitey and the other panelists shared their experiences as women in the workplace, their efforts to bring positive change, and their vision of a more equitable future.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey said she is proud of Code the Dream&#8217;s workplace environment. “One of the moms on our team brought her daughter to the office on a snowday,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “And I thought,&nbsp;<em>This is exactly what I wanted to build.</em>&nbsp;She did not ask for permission. She did not call. She just knew, because we were moms, because we understood, that she could bring her child. That is what I tried to build every day.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a nonprofit tech organization, Code the Dream relies on software development volunteers to make our program a success. We are grateful for every single volunteer that works to support our students and apprentices in the many ways they show up: mentoring, leading workshops, reviewing assignments, pair programming, project coaching and more!</p>



<p>But some go above and beyond. We are excited to recognize that service and celebrate their contributions by honoring CTD&#8217;s Volunteer of the Month.</p>



<p>February&#8217;s volunteer of the month is Kon Ham! Thanks for all your work, Kon! </p>



<p>When asked why he values his work s a CTD volunteer, Kon responded with this message:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My name is Kon. I&#8217;m a software engineer at a growing tech startup in Boston, Massachusetts that builds products for engineering management.</p><p>I was born in Korea. My parents immigrated to the US when I was 1 or 2 years old.</p><p>I love coding because coding gives me an opportunity to be part of a team that solves problems creatively, elegantly, and effectively. I love coding because there is sufficient depth of material that I know I can spend the rest of my life improving my coding skills. Finally, I love coding because it gives me a fulfilling job that meets my lifestyle needs.</p><p>I love to volunteer at Code the Dream because it is an encouragement to see new faces every day that are desiring to learn a valuable skill to contribute to the growing field of tech. Those new faces are a representation of the many different cultures, backgrounds, and experiences that can one day be leveraged to make the world a better place.</p><p>I love volunteering at Code the Dream because it is a mission that is close to my heart. For approximately 20 years I was undocumented in a country that I loved.</p><p>I love the people, I love the land, and I love the values. Because of that, six months after I was naturalized, I joined the armed services as an enlisted member of the United States military. But for better or worse, that experience of being undocumented made a deep and lasting impression on me.</p><p>With my background in mind, I continue my tradition of being in service to others by volunteering my time at Code the Dream. I volunteer here because I believe people are not wrong or criminals for existing. I believe those same people from traditionally underrepresented or historically excluded groups can demonstrate and contribute value in a growing and incredibly important industry.</p><p>I volunteer at Code the Dream because I believe that I can make an impact on this field by volunteering my time be a mentor.</p><p>Do you want to make a lasting impact on the lives of others? </p><p>Mentor with Code the Dream. It is hard work but oftentimes great things can follow from hard work.</p><p>Sign up with Code the Dream today!&#8221;</p><cite>Kon Ham</cite></blockquote>

Code the Dream saw my ceiling, the people from the organization stuck with me even when I struggled. They saw that I worked hard, and they went out of their way to help me find resources so I could keep pursuing this career.

<p>Code the Dream&#8217;s Daisy Magnus-Aryitey discussed her path to a coding career, her new position as Co-Executive Director, and CTD&#8217;s recent growth and exciting future  in this Q&amp;A with WRAL&#8217;s TechWire. </p>



<p>When asked about the importance of diversity in tech, Magnus-Aryitey responded: &#8220;We know that if we want to solve complex, real-world problems we need people from diverse backgrounds deeply involved at every step of the way to help build new technology that makes a difference. Innovation requires different points of view and thrives on diverse perspectives. So giving these sharp, driven minds a place to be productive benefits us all. But it’s also the right thing to do — there is no good reason for the tech industry to be excluding so many people, and changing that addresses crucial issues like income inequality and access to health care.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="/"><br>Code the Dream</a> (CTD) is proud to announce Daisy Magnus-Aryitey as the organization’s new Co-Executive Director. Most recently Code the Dream’s Director of Partnerships, Magnus-Aryitey will join Executive Director Dan Rearick in leading day-to-day operations and mapping the path for the fast-growing non-profit.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey is uniquely suited for the position, having been a student in an early version of Code the Dream, co-founding the current incarnation with Dan Rearick and Ramiro Rodriguez, and serving as Director of Programs, Board Vice-Chair, and Director of Partnerships.</p>



<p>“I’m delighted to step into the role of Co-Executive Director,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “This organization, its people and mission, have a special place in my heart. I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far, and I’m energized thinking about what’s next.”</p>



<p>A native of Ghana, Magnus-Aryitey moved to the US when she was four and came to North Carolina in 2009. She completed classes in a Code the Dream pilot program, and within a year was working as a full-time software developer at Duke University.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey is an obvious choice to help lead Code the Dream as it continues to expand and develop, Rearick said.</p>



<p>“From our board and staff to our partners, everyone is excited because of Daisy&#8217;s wisdom and vision, as well as her lived experience that mirrors that of many Code the Dream students,” he said. “Daisy embodies so much of what makes Code the Dream a compelling model and a wonderful community, and it&#8217;s an honor to work alongside her.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CTD has more than tripled its scope over the last two years, from its start as a grassroots organization serving aspiring programmers and software developers in North Carolina to serving students and communities across the country, from a permanent staff of 4 to a staff of 19, with 34 full time software apprentices. The 39 apps and websites built by CTD Labs now serve marginalized communities around the country.</p>



<p><a href="/">Code the Dream</a> envisions a world in which tech innovation comes from all of us and benefits all of us. To that end, the North Carolina-based national nonprofit&#8217;s mission is to create opportunity that changes lives, build technology that benefits communities, and support the diversity that drives a more just and innovative world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Code the Dream works with people from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, people of color, immigrants, and people from low-income communities. Code the Dream is unique in that participants gain real-world experience by building web and mobile technologies that benefit communities in need, then use that experience to launch new careers with life-changing opportunity for themselves and their families.</p>

<p>The six member-owners of <a href="https://www.radiateconsulting.coop/north-carolina-tech-coop">Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina</a> decided that their tech expertise combined with a collective-ownership model was their best route to business ownership and a rewarding career trajectory. After working for months, supported by <a href="/">Code the Dream</a> and the <a href="https://institute.coop/">Democracy at Work Institute</a> (DAWI), they launched the new business at an event on September 2.</p>



<p>“Radiate Consulting North Carolina aims to bring affordable tech-based solutions to a variety of organizations such as non-profits, government and educational agencies, small to medium businesses to name a few, as a means to help them succeed, and grow with the current age of modern technology,” said member-owner Rod Chavez at the launch event. “Radiate aims to help [customers] fill any technological gaps &amp; needs, while empowering our diverse team of member-owners.”</p>



<p>Chavez and Brian Espinosa, both graduates of Code the Dream’s educational programs who went on to be apprentices at <a href="/services/">CTD Labs</a>, decided to pursue a cooperative business model in 2020 and started recruiting members in early 2021. They were joined by CTD grads Kevin Arevalo and Sinan Cengiz, as well as Ian Peoples and Guillermo Hernandez Flores to round out a team with a diverse set of complementary skills. All of the founding member-owners are web/mobile application developers and administrators.</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina is the fourth Radiate worker cooperative, and the first to focus on providing tech solutions. As a worker cooperative, the business is both owned and managed by its workers. Together, they ensure fair wages are provided, a healthy work environment is maintained, and—most notably— all Radiate professionals share the profits the business generates.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of opportunity in the cooperative way that we’re approaching things,” said Espinosa. “Currently we have two major contracts and we’re looking to grow quickly, and to grow together. We have so many strengths among the six of us, and I’m excited about harnessing those to grow this business.”</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina launched with support from <a href="/">Code the Dream</a>, a North Carolina-based nonprofit providing high-level software development education to people from diverse low-income backgrounds, and the <a href="https://institute.coop/">Democracy at Work Institute</a>, an organization working to expand worker ownership to reach communities locked out of business ownership opportunities, especially BIPOC, immigrant, and low-wage workers.</p>



<p>“Each year, tens of thousands of university, community college, and advanced degree program students are blocked from working in their chosen fields or obtaining the jobs their skills demand,” said Vanessa Bransburg, managing director at DAWI. “Radiate creates business ownership opportunities for skilled professionals who are facing obstacles like inconsistent contingent work, hiring and workplace discrimination, wage theft, and more.”</p>



<p>In addition to supporting their launch, Code the Dream is Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina’s first client.</p>



<p>“We are happy to see some of our grads go on to such a promising endeavor,” said Code the Dream co-founder Daisy Magnus-Aryitey. “We already have a contract with Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;North Carolina, and we are thrilled to have a chance to continue to work with these motivated, skilled individuals.”&nbsp;</p>
