The instruction was much more nuanced than I had gotten from other classrooms, and the collaboration with other students taught me so much. We were all working together for a common goal &#8212; I\u2019m still in touch with the people from my Code the Dream classes.\u00a0<\/p><p>I think tech is a natural fit for veterans, who know how to work hard and solve problems. But I know that it can be hard to transition back into civilian life. That\u2019s why I recommend Code the Dream. If you\u2019re willing to work hard, they will stick with you and help you. Code the Dream saw my ceiling, the people from the organization stuck with me even when I struggled. They saw that I worked hard, and they went out of their way to help me find resources so I could keep pursuing this career. The structure and support helped me, and my career path started making sense.
