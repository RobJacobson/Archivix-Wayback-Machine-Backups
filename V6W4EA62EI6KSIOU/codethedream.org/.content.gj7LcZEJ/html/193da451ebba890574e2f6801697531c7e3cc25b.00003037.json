That\u2019s not the case for Raleigh-based software company Pendo, which is working to deliver on those promises.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPendo is full of people with unique backgrounds and perspectives, and we are always looking for ways to add to that diversity,\u201d said Leslie Neitzel, vice president of people at Pendo. \u201cAs we set hiring plans for the year, we identified some roles in our organization where we could create opportunities for people from underrepresented backgrounds just coming into the workforce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Neitzel, who serves as the head of HR, added, \u201cIt is important for us to reflect the places in which we live and serve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This year Pendo piloted its first student sponsorship to Momentum Learning, a coding school in Durham, complete with a job offer for the student upon the successful completion of Momentum\u2019s program. Pendo and Momentum are no strangers to collaboration as they have previously partnered for events like tech trainings and seminars.<\/p>\n<p>Neitzel said the scholarship is a platform that gives someone from an underrepresented community an opportunity to pursue a career path they may not have considered otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>This year\u2019s lucky scholarship recipient is 23-year-old Jocelyn Casanova, who will join Pendo as a technical success engineer after her cohort wraps up.<\/p>\n<p>Casanova, as a woman and a Latina, represents something that is often missing in the dev industry, the presence of females and minorities alike. It\u2019s estimated that less than 20 percent of tech jobs are held by women. Additionally, there are half as many Hispanics and African Americans in tech compared to the rest of the private sector.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a person that has a passion for creating \u2014 I love making things, whether it\u2019s through art or something else. To me, coding is like a form of art. It\u2019s also complicated and abstract and takes on a different meaning from different angles for different people,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cCoding is something that I can take with me anywhere \u2014 it\u2019s a universal language.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The application of a coding education across several industries and even borders is not lost on Casanova.<\/p>\n<p>Though ambitious and intelligent, Casanova\u2019s post-high school journey has not been easy. After graduating from high school with honors, a personal situation made her ineligible for in-state tuition, throwing a wrench in her university plans. Unable to afford the cost of out-of-state tuition, Casanova enrolled at Wake Technical Community College part-time while simultaneously working several jobs to pay her way through. But the cycle of missing school for work and starting class again only to find herself financially overwhelmed never seemed to let up.<\/p>\n<p>Around that time, her mother saw an ad for Code the Dream, an organization that offers computer programming classes to people from low-income and diverse backgrounds, and encouraged her to look into it.<\/p>\n<p>Casanova learned Ruby on Rails (a coding framework) and was hired to work on staff at Code the Dream. Juggling the course work and multiple jobs again proved to be challenging and Casanova wasn\u2019t able to complete the entire program. However, Code the Dream heard about the Pendo scholarship opportunity at Momentum and encouraged her to apply.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJocelyn was like many of our students; she was an amazing high school student and was very involved, made great grades \u2026 but she couldn\u2019t get federal financial aid [for college]. Students like Jocelyn are a big part of why we started Code the Dream in the first place,\u201d said Dan Rearick, executive director of Code the Dream. \u201cShe did our initial classes and did well, but she wasn\u2019t able to keep going and complete our entire program. In some ways, it\u2019s all the more wonderful that she\u2019s been able to get this opportunity with Momentum.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rearick said Casanova lit up the room every time she was in class and calls her an \u201camazing people person.\u201d Her affability will be an asset, as successful developers tend to work well with others, building strong teams that foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Even though Casanova is fortunate to have a full-time job lined up already after she finishes Momentum\u2019s program, she\u2019s putting pressure on herself to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPendo is the reason why I\u2019m here, and I need to make sure that I am representing them well; and not just them, but myself and my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through lots of ups and downs being an immigrant, and I\u2019m just trying to be an inspiration for my little sister.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For right now, Momentum\u2019s program will be Casanova\u2019s full-time job before she starts at Pendo and she\u2019s absorbing as much as she can, as fast as she can. She said she is \u201csleeping, breathing and thinking about coding\u201d all day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can, making friends and trying to understand the concepts \u2014 I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m able to learn and be here,\u201d said Casanova, who frequently took the opportunity to communicate how grateful she is to be at Momentum. She mentioned the rigorous nature of the program and the adjustment period she had to go through, but said a positive mindset makes all the difference.<\/p>\n<p>After being selected from a group of scholarship applicants, Casanova\u2019s optimism and perseverance came through in her interview with the Pendo team. In addition to the diversity component, Neitzel said Pendo was looking for someone who was curious, interested in technology and passionate about serving customers. Neitzel said the team was impressed by Casanova\u2019s passion and her desire to \u201cleave the world a better place than she found it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe has a very strong work ethic,\u201d Neitzel said. Diligence is a trait all Momentum students must have in order to get through the courses. \u201cWe\u2019ve hired previous Momentum graduates who have been successful here at Pendo. We know this program prepares its graduates for both the skill requirements and demands of today\u2019s tech jobs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Neitzel emphasized the Pendo-sponsored Momentum scholarship is just one step in the company\u2019s effort to continue to build an inclusive workforce.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that someone like Joceyln has the opportunity to contribute to that,\u201d Neitzel said. \u201cOur culture is not something that is defined by HR or even the leadership team. Our employees are the co-creators of our culture. When you continue to bring diversity into an arena, you become a better reflection of society.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>You can see Casanova and her classmates present their final projects at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/momentum-demo-day-summer-2019-tickets-64745543664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momentum\u2019s upcoming Demo Day<\/a>.
