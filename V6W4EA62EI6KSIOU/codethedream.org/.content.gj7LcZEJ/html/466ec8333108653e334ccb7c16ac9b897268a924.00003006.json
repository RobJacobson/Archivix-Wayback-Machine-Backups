Apply!<\/strong> Fill out the Interest Application prior to the deadline (apply <a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/classes\">here<\/a>). We will be hosting an informational video call and Live Q&amp;A session at least once during every application period.  Information on those events can be found above in the \"Virtual Info Session\" section of this page.  (Follow Code the Dream on Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/code_the_dream\/\">here<\/a> and Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/codethedream\">here<\/a>). <\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2. Pre-work.<\/strong> The day after the application deadline, we will send out a pre-work assignment which potential students must complete before being considered for any of the classes.  You will have 2 weeks in which to begin and complete the pre-work, but the work itself is typical of the amount of work you should expect each week of class.  We estimate that the Pre-Work will take around 10 to 20 hours of work.  You can find more details about Pre-Work Virtual Info Sessions on our <a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/virtual-info-session\/\">Virtual Info Session page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3. Interview. <\/strong>Following completion of the pre-work assignment, Code the Dream will review all the submitted assignments.
