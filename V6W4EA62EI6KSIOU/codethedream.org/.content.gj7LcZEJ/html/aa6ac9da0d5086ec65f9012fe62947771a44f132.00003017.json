The student authors of the selected projects will be the student leads and they will be responsible for project management duties (like managing a Kanban board and tickets in GitHub Projects). The volunteer Practicum Project Lead supervises one team of three to four students over the one to two month timeline of the Practicum. They support their team by helping students&nbsp;address issues in their code and resolve merge conflicts, meeting with their project team on a weekly basis, and being available intermittently throughout the week to respond to questions&nbsp;in the project\u2019s Slack channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Practicum project leads are typically responsible for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Coordinating and leading weekly meetings with their team of students<\/li><li>Maintaining communication via Slack between the students working on a project<\/li><li>Assisting student developers on blockers or other questions related to the project that the students cannot resolve themselves<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Special Note: In the event students don\u2019t offer their final projects as a practicum project, we are always looking to identify good projects to serve as a practicum, so if you have a non-for-profit app you\u2019d like to lead a team in creating, we\u2019re all for it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example: Antonio, a React developer, led a team of recent CTD student graduates through creating and deploying their first app.&nbsp; He coordinated weekly meetings, and guided the students through how to collaborate on Github repositories, helping them learn how to approach merge conflicts.
