(WTVD) &#8212; Crystal Williams-Brown is the poster child for &#8216;Code the Dream&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The college graduate couldn&#8217;t find work in her first chosen field and decided she really wanted to be a computer programmer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As I was looking around at a lot of those schools it was very expensive to go and I wasn&#8217;t working at the time so I didn&#8217;t have a way to afford it,&#8221; she told ABC11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then she heard about a program in Research Triangle Park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They suggested Code the Dream because it was free. I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Well, that&#8217;s exactly what I can afford,'&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon she joined the ranks of those learning to write computer code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are so many reasons why people may not be able to get ahead especially if that requires a computer science degree. So we wanted to make sure that people from all different backgrounds really had a chance to have a successful career,&#8221; said Dan Rearick one of the founders of Code the Dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, the graduate of Apex High School, UNC-CH, and Harvard Law School decided to give up corporate trappings and start a nonprofit to help mostly people in need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained how the program meets that goal saying, &#8220;Code the Dream is open to everybody but we do have a thumb on the scale in favor of people from low-income backgrounds. It&#8217;s a free program so when we can we want to make sure we help those who have no other options.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once people learn to program they practice in labs and actually create apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where this nonprofit pays it forward to other nonprofits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s a nonprofit that can&#8217;t afford an app, they come to Code the Dream to get it done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Williams-Brown is one of the graduates who ended up going to work for Code the Dream and is now helping others who serve the community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first assignment was helping Families Together, a nonprofit agency in Raleigh that helps recently homeless families find services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needed an app to connect people with free rides to job interviews; something Williams-Brown could have used herself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was as rewarding as a job can get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I was also very proud because one of my issues with getting employment is I didn&#8217;t have transportation and I didn&#8217;t have a way to pay for transportation. So then there were a lot of jobs that weren&#8217;t available to me,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Space at Code the Dream is limited.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last class for 30 people had 200 applicants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to help provide services to more people like Williams-Brown your donation would be appreciated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>RALEIGH, N.C.
