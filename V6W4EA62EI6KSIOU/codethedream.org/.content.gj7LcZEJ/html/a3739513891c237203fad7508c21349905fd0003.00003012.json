We use the web app to plan our outreach, and we use the mobile app to locate labor camps, track our visits and donations, and make notes about anything that needs attention. Thanks to the app, our work is more efficient and productive. It used to take hours to plan outreach; now it only takes a few minutes!\u201d<\/p><cite>&#8211;Lariza Garzon, Executive Director, Episcopal Farm Worker Ministry, North Carolina<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Personally, I was excited about Vamos because of the streamlining. Before Vamos, we used a case database, excel sheets, all of our individual cell phones cameras, running Microsoft documents etc. to keep all of out outreach teams organized for reporting and planning purposes. With Vamos we have a one-stop-shop for everything. The experience with the Vamos team has been wonderful. Any issue I had was taken care of immediately and I was never made to feel like I was bothering them. The experience with the Vamos app as been equally great. It has been a huge time saver in that everything I need is in one spot. It has also helped me stay organized much more than years passed. Totally recommend any outreach workers give it a try.&#8221;<\/p><cite>&#8211;Molly Spaak, Migrant Legal Aid, Michigan<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Vamos App is poised to transform the way that we plan outreach and collect data. We could not be more excited to streamline our efforts in order to maximize our ability to form a fruitful relationship with our client base.&#8221; <\/p><cite>&#8211;\u00a0Mario Solis and Elise Riveness, the Agricultural Worker Project, Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cost<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing and maintaining complex mobile apps like Vamos requires significant time and resources on the part of our software developers.  We want this technology to be accessible and affordable to groups doing important work to improve the lives of farmworkers, so we are willing to work with groups as much as possible though a sliding scale cost. The cost will be between $1000 -$5000 per year (or monthly payments of between $100 and $500 per month) per organizational subscription to use and maintain Vamos. For organizations with more than 5 outreach workers, the cost could be higher, because the more people who use it and the more data collected, the more resources it requires to maintain. For organizations that cannot afford this range, please let us know and let&#8217;s see what we can work out. We want to make sure the groups who need it can use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Groups that have additional needs beyond what is currently included in the app can also work with us to design organization-specific features for additional building costs. For example, we have worked with one group to build a module for documenting specific concerns around wage issues, and with another group to build a module to track the specific donations they pass out to workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please talk to us about the needs and resources of your specific organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blog Post: An App for the Ministry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-code-the-dream\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GMZ8850bu9\"><a href=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/an-app-for-the-ministry\/\">An App for the Ministry<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;An App for the Ministry&#8221; &#8212; Code the Dream\" src=\"https:\/\/codethedream.org\/an-app-for-the-ministry\/embed\/#?secret=GMZ8850bu9\" data-secret=\"GMZ8850bu9\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Want your staff to use Vamos?
